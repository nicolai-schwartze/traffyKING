# traffyKING
This project is about simulating and optimising a the flow-control of an intersection. 

The trafficlights are round-based scheduled. 

For simulating the [Simulation of Urban MObility](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/) (short SUMO) software is used.

The optimisation is done by 4 different algorithms: 

*Conjugate Gradient Descent
*NSGA II
*Differential Evolution
*Hill Climbint

The performance of these algorithms is compared on 3 different traffic scenarios.
