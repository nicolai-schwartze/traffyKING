# traffyKING
This project is about simulating and optimising a the flow-control of an intersection. 

The trafficlights are round-based scheduled. 

For simulating the [Simulation of Urban MObility](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/) (short SUMO) software is used.

The optimisation is done by different evolutionary algorithms.
